           <H1>Driven by Purpose, Defined by Discipline</H1>  
           <br>           
            <p>
            I was raised in Las Vegas, Nevada, in a family that emphasized hard work, accountability, and faith. As the second of four children born to Derek and Kelli Banks, I learned early how to balance independence with responsibility. Growing up in a fast-paced and often unforgiving environment taught me resilience, adaptability, and the importance of character. Those formative years shaped my work ethic and instilled in me a drive to continually improve, regardless of circumstance.
            </p>

            <p>
            Faith has played a central role in my life and decision-making. As a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I chose to serve a full-time mission in Chile. That experience fundamentally changed the way I view service, discipline, and leadership. Living in a foreign country, learning a new language, and dedicating myself entirely to others strengthened my ability to communicate, endure discomfort, and remain focused on long-term goals. My mission taught me humility, emotional intelligence, and how to work relentlessly even when progress felt invisible.
            </p>

            <p>
            After returning home, I began my studies at Brigham Young University, eager to apply what I had learned to both my education and professional development. BYU became a place where I refined my values, expanded my worldview, and continued building a foundation for a meaningful career. While pursuing my education, I worked consistently, believing that experience is just as valuable as theory when it comes to personal growth.
            </p>

            <p>
            My professional journey began early through work as a youth sports referee, a role that demanded fairness, decisiveness, and composure under pressure. Managing conflict and making real-time decisions taught me confidence and accountability, especially in situations where criticism was unavoidable. From there, I moved into solar sales, where I developed resilience, persuasion skills, and the ability to handle rejection constructively. Sales challenged me to refine my communication, listen actively, and maintain discipline despite fluctuating outcomes.
            </p>

            <p>
            Seeking physically and mentally demanding work, I later served as a wildland firefighter. This experience tested my endurance, teamwork, and ability to operate in high-risk environments. Firefighting reinforced the importance of preparation, trust, and calm execution under pressure. It remains one of the most formative experiences of my life, shaping how I approach adversity and responsibility.
            </p>

            <p>
            My career continued at Schaffer Industries in Lindon, Utah, where I worked as a welder. Starting on the production floor, I learned the value of precision, consistency, and accountability. Through initiative and a willingness to learn, I worked my way into a steel sales role, gaining firsthand experience in manufacturing operations, client relations, and technical sales. That progression reinforced my belief that effort and reliability create opportunity.
            </p>

            <p>
            I later transitioned into automotive sales as a car salesman at Ford in Provo. This role sharpened my negotiation skills, customer service approach, and ability to perform in a competitive, results-driven environment. I learned how to build rapport quickly, understand client needs, and guide people through high-stakes decisions with transparency and professionalism.
            </p>

            <p>
            Today, I work as a Down Payment Assistance (DPA) and loan assistant focused on helping FHA homebuyers navigate one of the most significant financial decisions of their lives. This role combines my background in sales, service, and communication with a deeper sense of purpose. I take pride in helping individuals and families access opportunities that might otherwise feel out of reach, and I approach this responsibility with care, precision, and integrity.
            </p>

            <p>
            Beyond my professional life, I am deeply committed to personal growth. I relocated to Thailand to train in mixed martial arts, immersing myself in a demanding physical and mental discipline that requires humility, resilience, and consistency. MMA training has strengthened my focus, discipline, and ability to remain composed under stress — traits that carry directly into my professional and personal life.
            </p>

            <p>
            Family remains a cornerstone of who I am. I am engaged to be married on April 26, 2025, to my fiancée, Liric Lapointe. Our relationship is built on shared values, mutual support, and a commitment to growth. Preparing for marriage has further deepened my sense of responsibility and long-term thinking, reinforcing my desire to build a stable, meaningful future.
            </p>

            <p>
            Looking back, each phase of my life — from growing up in Las Vegas, serving in Chile, working physically demanding jobs, pursuing sales and leadership roles, and training abroad — has contributed to the person I am today. I bring resilience, adaptability, and integrity into everything I do. I am motivated not by convenience or comfort, but by progress, contribution, and purpose.
            </p>

            <p>
            I view life and work as opportunities to build trust, refine character, and create lasting value. Whether in professional environments, personal relationships, or personal pursuits, I strive to show up fully, work diligently, and leave things better than I found them.
            </p>
