            <h2 class="title">A Skillset Built Through Experience</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sales & Negotiation:</strong> Two years of experience in solar sales with proven results in high-pressure environments.</li>
                <li><strong>Languages:</strong> English (native), Spanish (fluent), Portuguese.</li>
                <li><strong>Writing & Creativity:</strong> Fiction writer; author of <em>Dawn of Men</em>.</li>
                <li><strong>Philosophy & Art:</strong> Academic focus on aesthetics, meaning, and artistic expression.</li>
                <li><strong>Research & History:</strong> Interest in historical analysis, systems, and construction techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Combat Sports & Fitness:</strong> MMA training emphasizing discipline, endurance, and resilience.</li>
                <li><strong>Leadership & Conflict Resolution:</strong> Three years as a youth sports referee requiring decisiveness and fairness.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            My skillset is the result of deliberate exposure to demanding environments rather than comfort or convenience. I have consistently pursued roles and challenges that require accountability, adaptability, and sustained effort. As a result, my abilities are not theoretical — they are tested, practiced, and refined through real-world experience.
            </p>

            <p>
            Communication is one of my most developed skills. Through sales, leadership, and service-oriented roles, I have learned how to clearly articulate value, listen actively, and adjust messaging based on audience and context. Whether educating homeowners, resolving conflict on a sports field, or collaborating with colleagues, I prioritize clarity, respect, and outcomes.
            </p>

            <p>
            My background in sales sharpened my negotiation skills and emotional intelligence. Rejection, objections, and high expectations are not deterrents for me — they are familiar elements of growth. I understand how to remain composed, persuasive, and ethical under pressure while maintaining long-term relationships built on trust.
            </p>

            <p>
            Leadership has been a recurring theme throughout my experiences. From managing teams to mentoring peers and enforcing structure in competitive environments, I have learned that leadership is rooted in consistency and example. I hold myself to high standards first, knowing that credibility is earned through action rather than position.
            </p>

            <p>
            Physical discipline has played a significant role in shaping my mental resilience. Through MMA training and physically demanding work, I have developed focus, perseverance, and an ability to perform while fatigued or under stress. These traits translate directly into professional settings, especially those requiring sustained effort and problem-solving.
            </p>

            <p>
            Creativity and critical thinking complement my professional abilities. As a fiction writer and student of philosophy and art, I enjoy exploring ideas, patterns, and perspectives beyond conventional frameworks. This creative foundation enhances my ability to think strategically, approach problems from multiple angles, and communicate with depth and originality.
            </p>

            <p>
            Ultimately, my skills are unified by discipline and intentional growth. I actively seek feedback, refine my weaknesses, and build upon my strengths. I am not satisfied with static competence — I pursue mastery through consistent effort, reflection, and application.
