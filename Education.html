            <h2 class="title">My Commitment to Education</h2>

            <p>
            Education has never been a box to check for me — it has been a long, deliberate journey shaped by persistence, sacrifice, and growth. My academic path has not been linear or effortless, but it has been deeply meaningful. I view education as both a privilege and a responsibility, and I approach it with the same discipline and seriousness that I bring to my professional life.
            </p>

            <p>
            After graduating from Basic Academy of International Studies in 2020, I carried forward a strong respect for structure, accountability, and global awareness. That foundation prepared me not only for college-level academics, but for navigating challenges beyond the classroom. I learned early that education extends beyond textbooks and lectures; it is built through experience, reflection, and sustained effort.
            </p>

            <p>
            My time at Brigham Young University represents a continuation of that commitment. Balancing coursework with demanding professional roles, service, and personal development has required focus, sacrifice, and time management. Rather than viewing these challenges as obstacles, I have treated them as opportunities to strengthen discipline and reinforce the value of education in real-world application.
            </p>

            <p>
            Serving a full-time mission in Chile and later training internationally required me to step away from traditional academic timelines. Those experiences, however, did not interrupt my education — they expanded it. They deepened my cultural understanding, strengthened my communication skills, and clarified my long-term goals. Returning to formal education with renewed perspective has made me more intentional, motivated, and appreciative of the opportunity to learn.
            </p>

            <p>
            I value education because it develops critical thinking, humility, and long-term vision. It teaches patience and resilience, especially when progress is gradual. I take pride in pursuing my degree with purpose, knowing that the effort I invest today compounds over time. My academic journey reflects persistence rather than convenience, and commitment rather than complacency.
            </p>

            <p>
            Education, to me, is preparation — preparation to serve more effectively, lead more responsibly, and contribute more meaningfully. I am committed to lifelong learning, both formally and independently, and I view each course, certification, and experience as a step toward becoming a more capable professional and individual.
            </p>
