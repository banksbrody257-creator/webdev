            <h2 class="title">Professional Experience & Work Philosophy</h2>

            <p>
            My professional experience reflects a deliberate pursuit of environments that demand responsibility, resilience, and results. I have consistently sought roles that require more than minimal effort — positions where performance, discipline, and accountability directly impact outcomes. Across sales, service, leadership, and physically demanding fields, I have built a reputation for reliability, adaptability, and sustained execution.
            </p>

            <p>
            In sales-driven roles, I have learned that success is earned through preparation, consistency, and an ability to communicate value clearly. My time as a Solar Sales Representative required self-discipline, rejection tolerance, and strategic thinking. Managing and leading a team reinforced the importance of setting standards, holding others accountable, and leading by example. These experiences strengthened my ability to operate independently while contributing to team-wide objectives.
            </p>

            <p>
            Working in high-risk and high-pressure environments, such as wildland firefighting, further shaped my professional mindset. Firefighting demanded mental clarity, physical endurance, and unwavering trust in team members. Decisions were often time-sensitive and carried real consequences, reinforcing the importance of preparation, situational awareness, and calm execution under stress.
            </p>

            <p>
            My experience training and working within a professional MMA environment in Thailand sharpened my discipline, humility, and resilience. Combat sports require consistent effort, respect for process, and the ability to receive feedback without ego. These qualities translate directly into the workplace, particularly in roles that demand sustained focus and personal accountability.
            </p>

            <p>
            Earlier roles, including youth sports officiating and restaurant service during the COVID-19 pandemic, taught me foundational professional skills: conflict resolution, customer service, time management, and teamwork. Officiating youth sports developed decisiveness and fairness, while fast-paced service work reinforced adaptability and communication under pressure.
            </p>

            <p>
            My service as a full-time missionary in Chile remains one of the most formative professional and personal experiences of my life. Living and working in a foreign country strengthened my ability to communicate across cultures, lead peers, manage schedules, and remain productive in challenging conditions. Achieving fluency in Spanish and mentoring others further developed my leadership and interpersonal skills.
            </p>

            <p>
            Taken together, my experience reflects a consistent pattern: I pursue responsibility, perform under pressure, and contribute beyond what is required. I value environments that reward effort, integrity, and initiative, and I bring those same standards into every role I accept.
            </p>
